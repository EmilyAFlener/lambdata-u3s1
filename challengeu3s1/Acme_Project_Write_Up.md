Emily Fleners Acme Project Write Up


What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is 
something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate
when others do the same for your code?

    In my experience the most important part of code review is documentation.
    Not only is PEP8 important but humanistic writing and further insights 
    are vital to efficiently progressing projects and the company mission.
    Understanding the thought process behind a specific piece of work allows
    for thoughtful problem solving of not only code but the business objective 
    of the project.



We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with
slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us
improve this situation?

    Due to rapid advancements in remote, or decentralized work, version and 
    environment control can get escalate quickly causing serious workflow 
    disruptions quickly if not properly addressed. Proactively researching 
    and stablishing organizational data sharing practices can mitigate fracturing
    of work, version control issues and current and future frustrations.
